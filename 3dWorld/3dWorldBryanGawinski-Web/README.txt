The idea of the world was changed from a jungle to a forest that can be found in 
the Appalachian Mountain Range.  The raccoons in the world will wander the environment 
until the explorer gets close.  When that occurs they will hide behind the closest rock
obstacle.  The bear cubs wander the environment as well and once the explorer gets close 
to them, the mother bear will interpose itself between you and her cubs.  There are also 
a flock of birds in the sky if you look for them.

The behaviors I implemented are hide, interpose, and put containment in again as well.

You move the player with WASD and jump with space bar.  You look around the environment
with the mouse.

To get the raccoons to stop hiding, you need to get close to them and they will flee.

The hide algorithm is inside the Hider.cs script. The interpose and containment behaviors 
can be found in the Steering.cs script.

Interesting things about my world is that I made all the models myself.  I made the bear, 
raccoon, bird, and rock.
